"""
Thinking Spinner Module - Terminal UI Component for User Feedback

This module provides a visual feedback mechanism for long-running operations,
specifically designed for AI agent processing where users need to know the
system is working on their request.

UI/UX DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Immediate Feedback: Users see activity within milliseconds of request
- Visual Clarity: Animated spinner clearly indicates processing state
- Non-intrusive: Minimal visual footprint, doesn't interfere with output
- Professional: Clean, console-appropriate animation style

THREADING ARCHITECTURE:
The spinner runs in a separate thread to avoid blocking the main application:
- Main Thread: Continues processing AI operations
- Spinner Thread: Manages animation loop and terminal output
- Synchronization: Thread-safe start/stop using threading events

CONTEXT MANAGER PATTERN:
Implements Python's context manager protocol for clean resource management:
- Automatic Start: Spinner begins when entering the context
- Automatic Stop: Spinner stops when exiting the context  
- Exception Safety: Spinner stops even if operation fails
- Resource Cleanup: Thread properly terminated in all scenarios

class ThinkingSpinner:
    """
    Terminal-based thinking spinner for providing user feedback during processing.
    
    This class implements a context manager that displays an animated spinner
    while long-running operations execute. Designed specifically for AI agent
    interactions where processing time can be unpredictable.
    
    VISUAL DESIGN:
    - Unicode spinner characters for smooth animation
    - "Thinking..." text for clear context
    - Carriage return (\r) for in-place updates
    - Flush output for immediate visibility
    
    THREADING MODEL:
    - Background Thread: Runs spinner animation loop
    - Event Synchronization: Uses threading.Event for clean shutdown
    - Non-blocking: Main thread continues processing while spinner runs
    - Resource Safety: Proper thread cleanup prevents resource leaks
    
    CONTEXT MANAGER BENEFITS:
    - Automatic lifecycle management
    - Exception-safe cleanup
    - Pythonic usage pattern with 'with' statements
    - Consistent behavior across all usage scenarios

        - stop_event: Threading event for signaling spinner shutdown
        - spinner_thread: Background thread for animation (created on start)
        
        DESIGN CHOICE:
        Thread creation is deferred until actual usage to avoid
        resource allocation during module import. This enables
        faster application startup and better resource efficiency.

        ANIMATION DESIGN:
        - Unicode Characters: ‚†ã‚†ô‚†π‚†∏‚†º‚†¥‚†¶‚†ß‚†á‚†è for smooth rotation effect
        - Frame Rate: 0.1 second intervals for smooth but not distracting animation
        - In-place Updates: Uses \r to overwrite previous frame
        - Immediate Output: sys.stdout.flush() ensures real-time visibility
        
        THREADING CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Non-blocking Check: stop_event.is_set() allows immediate shutdown
        - Exception Safety: Continues running even if output operations fail
        - Clean Termination: Responds quickly to stop signals
        
        TERMINAL COMPATIBILITY:
        - Unicode Support: Modern terminals support the spinner characters
        - Fallback: Could be enhanced with ASCII fallback for older terminals
        - Cross-platform: Works on Unix, Windows, and macOS terminals
